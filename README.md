# shopping_cart_react
Basic shopping cart with 1 item using React Hooks and Context APIs.

In this project, I have tried to use predefined item and its price, taxes.

User can use 'DISCOUNT' promocode to avail extra 10% discount. Coupon can be used only once.

Click on Item Details and Promo Code link to see collapsed value.
